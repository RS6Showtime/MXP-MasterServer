# MXP-MasterServer [Info]

Hey, this is a masterserver i've made for goldsrc engine. I did not tested for half life, but for counter-strike 1.6 work perfectly.

# What it does?

You can create your own browser of servers for people to share your favorites with others.

# What I need?

You only need python3.0+ to run it and to configure your files.

# What is so special about this project?

You have two file. One is with normal servers and the other one is with vip servers. Vip servers will always show on top. This was only tested on 2009 counter-strike build engine. I'm not sure if it will work with newest versions.

# Can I use traditional version of masterserver?

Yes, you can use it. This can be find in the folder "*classic*" where it will only send all full list of servers. This will also read from vip & normal file.

# Kinda boring to be honest...

Yea, i Know, but it's a good resource for people to continue doing good stuff for counter-strike 1.6 community.

install required python libs, in order to run the script:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
or
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
